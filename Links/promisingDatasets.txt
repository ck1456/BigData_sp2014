*****************************

Some ideas for relevant papers. I'm hoping to find writings that are related directly to what we're trying to do, but other papers may have interesting leads even if they do not answer the specific answers we have raised.

I am doing most of the searching on Google scholar and Bobcat.

Some of these will require Bobcat login to view, others can be viewed as pdf directly off Google.
